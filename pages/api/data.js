            It is a small island measuring eight square kilometers. 
            The visible landmass sinks during the tide. Alternatively called the pearl of the sea, it is about 10 km from the mainland at teknaf. 
            The safest means of transport is the government-owned ferry which takes around two hours one way. Tourists have the option to spend a few hours and return the same day or stay for one or two days.
             Due to ferry’s timing, one and a half days tour is practical. Relaxation and fun on the picturesque place of blue sky and coconut trees, swimming in crystal blue water, snorkeling in the lagoon, and walking in the fresh air will be a lifetime experience. 
             The seafood with its variety and taste has an appeal. There are a good number of hotels, guest houses, and eateries. There are a scuba diving facility and a sea turtle hatchery. Since it is a small island one can tour the entire area on foot in a few hours. 
             The permanent residents of the island, numbering around 8,000, are all fishermen.

But after the excavation a ground plan of a Buddhist monastery (measuring 550′ x 500′) with 115 monastic cells was exposed. After that it is now popularly known as Salban Vihara or Bihar. A dominant central shrine and its monumental gateway on the north is its special attraction.
               From one of the terracotta sealing, we came to know that this monastery was built by Sri Bhava Deva, the 4th ruler of the early Deva dynasty during mid 8th century A.D.; So during its hey-day it was called Bhava Deva Maha Vihara. The antiquities recovered during the excavation are now displayed at the Maynamati Museum.

              Forest is the lung of the Mother Earth. Without forest it’s impossible to live in the world. That’s mean no forest no life. The word “forest” comes from old French word forest (also fores). And the Bans word derives from the English Word Forest. The first known forests on Earth arose in the Late Devonian (approximately 380 million years ago), with the evolution of Archaeopteryx.

              A mangrove is a shrub or small tree that grows in coastal saline or brackish water. The term is also used for tropical coastal vegetation consisting of such species. Mangroves occur worldwide in the tropics and subtropics, mainly between latitudes 25° N and 25° S. The total mangrove forest area of the world in 2000 was 137,800 square kilometers (53,200 sq mi), spanning 118 countries and territories.

              Mangroves are salt-tolerant trees, also called halophytes, and are adapted to life in harsh coastal conditions. They contain a complex salt filtration system and complex root system to cope with salt water immersion and wave action. They are adapted to the low oxygen conditions of waterlogged mud. Although mangroves inhabit only 0.7% of global coastal zone, but they have a significant contribution to the global carbon. Primary production by mangroves provides a substantial source of energy for aquatic food webs.

The monument is located in Savar, about 35 km north-west of the capital, Dhaka. It was designed by Syed Mainul Hossain and built by Concord Group.
        //     The architecture is composed of seven pairs of triangular-shaped walls or prisms; the outermost pair being the shortest in height but widest in span, the inner pairs gradually change their aspect ratio and the innermost pair thus forms the peak point of the architecture. Each of these seven pairs of walls represents a significant chapter in the history of Bangladesh, namely the Language Movement in 1952, the provincial election victory of the United Front in 1954, the Constitution Movement in 1956, the movement against Education Commission in 1962, 6-point Movement in 1966, the Mass Uprising in 1969, and finally the climactic event of Liberation War in 1971, through which Bangladesh was liberated.

        //     The lake is bounded on three sides by mountain peaks covered with thick bamboo forests. The area of the lake is 18.56 acres (75,100 m2). It is a closed lake and there is a small spring named Boga chhara, which is 153 meters (502 ft) deep. There is no outlet for draining out water from the lake. The lake is composed of the soft rocks of the Bhuban Formation. The main source of water is rain in summer. The water is greenish due to the abundance of algae. The lake's bed is covered with boulders, like any other hill surface in that area. The lake's water was the only source of water for drinking, washing, and bathing until 2012. Later, a pipe network was set up to bring stream water for drinking and household activities.
